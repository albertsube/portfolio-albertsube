    title: "Full Stack Engineer - Nimbel Code",
    description:
      "Currently, I work as a Full Stack Developer at Nimbel Code, where I lead the development of web and mobile applications for fast-growing startups. One of the key projects Iâ€™ve contributed to is Famba, a telemedicine platform. I developed a mobile application using React and Capacitor for patient interaction, along with a React-based web platform for doctors. This application includes real-time chat functionality between patients and doctors using Firebase Firestore, and implements secure user authentication with Firebase Auth. The doctor's platform features a role-based authorization system, ensuring that access to specific features is granted based on user permissions. I also led the integration of Stripe payments, using Firebase Cloud Functions to manage secure, serverless backend logic. Another major project is NewsUp, a platform for journalists that includes both a custom CMS and a modular news website. The CMS, built with React, allows editorial teams to create and manage articles, configure layout components, and customize the site's appearance. It also integrates AI-powered tools through Google Gemini to assist in content generation and enhancement. The public-facing news site was developed using Astro, leveraging SSR, SSG, and ISR to deliver fast, dynamic content. The backend services were implemented using NestJS, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL, providing a robust infrastructure for content delivery and user management.",
